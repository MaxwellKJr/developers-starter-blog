_"After the end of World War 2, the world was split into two. East and West. This marked the beginning of era called the Cold War."_ - Naked Snake (Voiced by David Hayter) in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.

That's the opening line to one of my favorite video games of all time, Metal Gear Solid 3. So where's the connection with coding? Well I am just trying to let you know that my love for video games made led me to that path of writing code.

I enjoy video games so much. In fact they are still motivate me to continue coding. (Coding = money. Money = games. Yes that's the connection.)

####The Drive, The Curious Max

My love for video games led to this question, "HOW ARE VIDEO GAMES MADE?ðŸ¤”" Some of you might have asked yourself the same question at some point in your life. So that curiosity led to more curiosity and I got tired of asking myself the same question and I ended up googling stuff like, "how are video games made?", "how to make a video game", "is math a requirement for making video games?" and so on.

Now throughout my searches one word that kept coming up more often in the articles I read was, "programming" and that led to more curiosity and I no longer googled the same things as before. My google searches were now something like, "what is programming?", "how to start programming", "is coding similar to programming?"

In short. The more I googled the more I went further and further away from my first question. Little did I know that such curiosity would help me a long the way of this journey.

I still wanted to make video games and I was very determined on that. (I was so determined that I even thought of making my own Game Engine.) Nothing was going to stop me. I studied the greats like Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series).

####Programming For Dummies & C/C++

After enough reading and research of what I was putting myself into, I got hold of the book _Beginning Programming For Dummies: All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies_ by Wallace Wang and this might sound a little cliche but **it changed my life**.
