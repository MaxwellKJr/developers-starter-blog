_"After the end of World War 2, the world was split into two. East and West. This marked the beginning of era called the Cold War."_ - Naked Snake (Voiced by David Hayter) in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.

That's the opening line to one of my favourite video game series of all time, Metal Gear developed by **Kojima Productions** under the management of **Hideo Kojima**. Kojima is the reason I fell in love with video games and story telling but the latter is a story for another day.
